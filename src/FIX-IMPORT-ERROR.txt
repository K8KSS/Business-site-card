============================================================
              IMPORT ERROR FIXED!
     "@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2" and similar errors
============================================================


PROBLEM:
  Vite couldn't resolve imports like:
    import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2"
    import { cva } from "class-variance-authority@0.7.1"
  
  This is WRONG syntax - versions should NOT be in imports!


WHAT WAS FIXED:
  Changed in the following files:
  
  ‚úÖ components/ui/button.tsx
  ‚úÖ components/ui/badge.tsx
  ‚úÖ components/ui/avatar.tsx
  ‚úÖ components/ui/slider.tsx
  ‚úÖ components/ui/tabs.tsx


BEFORE (WRONG):
  import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot@1.1.2";
  import { cva } from "class-variance-authority@0.7.1";
  import * as AvatarPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-avatar@1.1.3";


AFTER (CORRECT):
  import { Slot } from "@radix-ui/react-slot";
  import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";
  import * as AvatarPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-avatar";


============================================================
  WHAT TO DO NOW:
============================================================

The server should now work!

If it's still running, refresh the browser:
  http://localhost:5173

If stopped, restart:
  npm run dev

Or:
  Double-click: start-windows.bat


============================================================
  WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?
============================================================

Someone probably manually edited the UI component files
and accidentally added version numbers to the imports.

In JavaScript/TypeScript, you should NEVER specify
versions in import statements!

Versions are specified in package.json, not in imports.


============================================================
  CORRECT IMPORT SYNTAX:
============================================================

‚úÖ CORRECT:
  import { Component } from "package-name"
  import * as Package from "package-name"
  import { thing } from "./local-file"

‚ùå WRONG:
  import { Component } from "package-name@1.2.3"
  import * as Package from "package-name@version"


============================================================

           All imports are now fixed! üéâ
           
           Refresh browser or restart server

============================================================
